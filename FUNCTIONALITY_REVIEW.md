## Summary
- Centralized the Google Fonts import into a shared stylesheet so that gameplay and instructional screens keep loading Open Sans even after conflict resolution.

## Verification
- Manual smoke test: open each HTML screen to confirm assets load without console errors and typography uses Open Sans.
